## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

This project was built to track and display the location of a given IP address using the **IP Geolocation API by IPify** for data retrieval and **LeafletJS** for interactive map rendering. JavaScript handles the logic and API integration, while Tailwind CSS powers the responsive design and layout.

Users can:

- Enter an IP address or domain name
- View geolocation details including city, region, country, ISP, and timezone
- See the location plotted on a dynamic map

The interface is optimized for clarity and mobile responsiveness, making it easy to use across devices.

## Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:

- Working with external APIs and parsing JSON responses
- Rendering dynamic maps with LeafletJS
- Building responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
- Structuring clean, modular JavaScript for real-time data updates

IP Tracker reflects the power of simple tools built with purpose. Itâ€™s a foundation for more advanced network utilities and educational resources to come.
